        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> St. Xavier's Senior Secondary School, Jaipur is a Christian minority school under the management of the Jesuits, an international Christian Religious Order, known as the Society of Jesus.

            St. Xavier's School for boys was founded in July, 1941 under the name of St. Mary's Boy's School in the Roman Catholic Church Compound at Ghat Gate, Jaipur by Rev. Fr. Ignatius, O.F.M. Cap. In July 1943 its management was entrusted to the Jesuit Fathers, renowned for their educational work. The school was transferred to the present site and renamed St. Xavier's School in January, 1945, and still later as St. Xavier's Sr. Sec. School.

For an educational institution an auditorium is not just a venue for school or college events, or merely a meeting place, it is a space where a corporation of students and scholars congregate – to celebrate, to debate, to discuss, and sometimes even to mourn collectively. As we stand at the threshold of another century in the history of St. Xavier’s College, it is meet that we go down memory lane and find out how students gathered here when it all began 130 odd years ago, how this place changed over the century, and how it is now poised to provide a space for even greater creative, cultural and social events, something that St. Xavier’s College has always been noted for. </p>
